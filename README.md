A simple **command-line Hangman word guessing game** built in Python.  
I created this project back in **2020** as one of my first Python learning exercises.  

The game has **two modes**:
1. **Player vs Computer** â†’ Computer randomly selects a secret word, and the player tries to guess it.
2. **Player vs Player** â†’ One player enters a secret word, and the other player tries to guess it.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
- Choose your game mode (vs Computer or vs Player).
- Guess the hidden word one letter at a time.
- Each wrong guess reduces your remaining attempts.
- Win if you guess the word before attempts run out. Lose if the hangman is complete.
